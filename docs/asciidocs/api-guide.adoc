[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

Parrot-REST application is a simple application that exposes to RESTs endpoints. One POST endpoint to listen and remember REST calls. The second endpoint is intended to talk or reproduce what was posted in the listen phase. . This application might be interesting in semi-integrated testing environments.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

Parrot-REST tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
